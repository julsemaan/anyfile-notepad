# Helping in the app translation

## Will you get paid ?

Yes, you will get 1% of last years revenues of this app. Which currently accounts to 0$.

More seriously, you will get a big thank you from me and a public one on the app home page.

## Will it be long ?

It shouldn't, there are currently 76 sentences to translate in the app so it should take less than an hour.

## Will it be complicated ?

We will simply send you the list of sentences with simple instructions on what to do and you simply have to email it back.

<b>NOTE: Translating the app will not translate your documents. If your documents are not read correctly by the app, the translation won't help at all. Refer to the first questions of the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> for details on this.</b>
