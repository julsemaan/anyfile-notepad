## What is Anyfile Notepad

Anyfile Notepad is a text editor that lets you open any type of files on Google Drive and Dropbox. To get started simply create or open a file using the built-in file explorer in the app.

You can also create and open files directly from the Google Drive web interface.

## How to open any type of files

The app can open a lot of files directly from the Drive UI (300+ types). If you cannot open a file with Anyfile Notepad directly in Google Drive use the 'Open' menu. Using this menu you can open all files on your Drive except Google Documents.

To open a Dropbox document, you need to use the app file explorer (Open menu)

## Creating files

Simply open the Anyfile Notepad app in your Chrome apps, <a href="/app#new">access it directly</a>, or create a new file through Google Drive. The app will automatically detect the mime type of your file based on the extension you put in the file name (html, js, css, c, cs, ...) so it works correctly with your other apps and Google Drive features.

## Usual disclaimers...

Please note that we cannot be responsible of any file corruption (not that we want it to happen) or anything destroying your files. This app will never send a destroy command to any of your files but note that non UTF-8 files can be corrupted when used with this app (don't worry the app will also warn you before doing it)

Please note that this program doesn't directly support non UTF-8 encoded documents (like PDF) but it is still possible to open them BUT they will be saved as UTF-8 so editing these files is highly unrecommended.

This app generates revenues to pay for its infrastructure and for the real time collaboration feature but nobody is paid to maintain it. Don't put your expectations too high but still feel free to provide (constructive) comments via <a href="/site/contact.html">our contact page</a>

## Security and privacy

Most important thing, your files and personal information are always encrypted from any server this app accesses to your computer and are secured by the most advanced TLS version your browser (and Google/Dropbox servers) will support.

All the content of your files is accessed directly by your device which means it doesn't go though our server so anything that happens with your data happens on your device or on Google's servers.

This app doesn't use a caching system for your files and doesn't store any personal information about you or your files. Your preferences are stored directly in your Drive.

This app will not store nor transfer your files to a third-party or to a server managed by us. The only information that can be sent is the mime type of a file you open in the event it is not already recognized natively by the app.

This website uses Google Analytics for traffic analysis. Refer to their privacy policy for details.

This app will never leverage your data and disclose it to third parties.
