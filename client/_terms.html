      <h4>Please take the time to read what this app does so you're not disapointed!</h4>

      <h4>FIRST : This is a simple plain text editor. Don't expect too much of it.</h4>
      <p>This app will technically open all files but they won't be readable by a human if they weren't initially meant to be. More precisly this means that opening a WORD document, PDF, image, video, etc, won't display it as you expect it. It will show you gibberish that you can't understand since its outputing the RAW binary content of the file.</p>
      <p>Now you're wondering why you can open this file with this app. This is because this app is mainly made for developers that use Google Drive. No app allowed to open any type of file so this app covers it. The weird type of files that a developer can encounter can now be opened.</p>
      <p>If you were trying to open an unsupported document, then I'm sorry I'm causing you disapointment. If you're trying to open a WORD or Pages document I'm sure you will find a more suitable app that does the job.</p>
      <p>
        Now to uninstall the app or for any other question, start by visiting the FAQ by
